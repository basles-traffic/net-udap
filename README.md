# Net-UDAP

## Overview

Net::UDAP is a Perl module to configure the Logitech SqueezeBox Receiver (SBR) from a PC, i.e. without requiring a SqueezeBox Controller (SBC).

I have tested on linux (Fedora 8), Windows XP (ActiveState perl and cygwin).

**Important** If you don't read anything else, read this: [wiki:GettingStarted Getting Started]

## Donations

Net-UDAP is free software - you do not have to pay to use it.

However, if you find Net-UDAP useful, you might like to make a donation - I've got ~~four~~ five kids to support!

## Documentation

## Requirements

 * On Unix:
   * perl v5.8.5, or later (it may work on earlier versions)
   * either subversion or unzip

 * On Windows:
   * ActiveState perl
   * optionally, TortoiseSVN (or similar) 

For the 1.0.0 release, all necessary modules should either be part of base perl, or are distributed with this module. 

Note: this will change in the next release. Net::UDAP will require installing one or two supporting perl modules from CPAN or using the ActiveState [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/PPM/ Perl Package Manager].

## News

### March 22, 2014

Imported code to github.

I have tried to update the documenttion to reflect the new location of the wiki, etc. but please let me know if I've missed anything.

### January 21, 2009

I just committed a change that switches to hex entry for WEP keys. This simply means that instead of entering a hex key like this: {{{abcd}}}, you should now enter it like this: {{{61626364}}}.

The change is in trunk, and also in a new 1.0.x branch I've created from the 1.0.0 release.

### January 9, 2009

Blimey, two updates in two days - what's going on???!!

I just noticed that the documentation doesn't mention anything about firewalls. Oooops. I've updated the [wiki:GettingStarted Getting Started] docs to include details of what size hole is required in the firewall.

For the record, the UDAP protocol uses broadcast traffic on port 17784 (udp).

Happy New Year all!

No major updates to report at this stage, but I've re-arranged the wiki documentation and updated the [wiki:GettingStarted Getting Started] documentation. Also, the registration procedure should now work so you can register, login, and create tickets to report any issue. Hell, you could even go crazy and edit the wiki to update the documentation!

A couple of points regarding getting the code:

 1. Most folk should grab the 1.0.0 Release () rather than the latest development code
 1. trac is able to dynamically create a zip file of any view of the code repository. What this means in practise is that it is not necessary to install subversion to get Net::UDAP - you can simply grab a zip archive. Look for the "Zip archive" link at the bottom of the page under "'''Download in other formats:'''"

### June 2, 2008

I've moved all my projects to a new server and a new version of trac.

Please [/register register] to be able to create/modify tickets and/or modify the wiki.
